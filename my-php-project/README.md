# My PHP Project

This is a simple PHP project that serves as a starting point for building PHP applications.

## Project Structure

```
my-php-project
├── public
│   └── index.php        # Entry point of the application
├── src
│   └── App.php         # Application logic
├── composer.json        # Composer configuration
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-php-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Composer installed. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```
   composer install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   You can use the built-in PHP server to run the application:
   ```
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to see the application in action.

## Usage Guidelines

- The `public/index.php` file is the main entry point for the application. You can modify this file to handle incoming requests as needed.
- The `src/App.php` file contains the core application logic. You can add methods to the `App` class to implement your application's functionality.
- Use `composer.json` to manage your project's dependencies and autoloading settings.
